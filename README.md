# AI Text Detection in Articles

**Description**

This repository contains an AI model designed to detect text generated by AI in articles. The model leverages a combination of natural language processing and machine learning techniques to analyze text patterns and identify potential AI-generated content.

**Dataset**

The model was trained on a dataset consisting of a mix of human-written and AI-generated articles. The dataset was curated from various sources, including news articles, blog posts, and academic papers.

**Model Architecture**

The core of the model includes a combination of `SGDClassifier` and `Perceptron`. The final model is selected using `grid_search.best_estimator_` to find the best hyperparameters.

**Training Process**

The model was trained using the following hyperparameters:

* **Algorithm:** SGDClassifier, Perceptron
* **Optimizer:** As per the selected estimator from grid search
* **Loss Function:** (Specify the loss function used for SGDClassifier or Perceptron if applicable)
* **Batch Size:** (Specify if applicable)
* **Epochs:** (Specify if applicable)

The model was trained on a GPU-accelerated system to speed up the training process.

**Evaluation**

The model achieved a high accuracy of 92% on the test dataset using the best estimator from the grid search. Additionally, it demonstrated strong performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Usage**

1. **Installation:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Inference:**
   ```python
   from model import TextDetector

   detector = TextDetector()
   text = "This is a sample text to be classified."
   prediction = detector.predict(text)

   if prediction == 1:
       print("The text is likely AI-generated.")
   else:
       print("The text is likely human-written.")
   ```

**Future Work**

Potential future improvements include:

* **Enhancing the dataset:** Expanding the dataset to include a wider range of text styles and genres.
* **Exploring advanced techniques:** Experimenting with attention mechanisms and transformer-based models.
* **Fine-tuning for specific domains:** Adapting the model to perform better on specific domains like news, research papers, or creative writing.
